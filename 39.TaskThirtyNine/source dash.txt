Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry Icouldnottravelboth
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth.

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Becauseitwasgrass yandwantedwear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same.

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yetknowinghowwayleadsonto way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads divergedin a wood, and I
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
